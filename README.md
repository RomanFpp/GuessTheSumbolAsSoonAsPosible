# GuessTheSumbolAsSoonAsPosible
If your word is shorter than or equal to five characters, the program starts forming the word from randomly generated characters from the array. 
Then the program compares your word with the generated one. If they coincide, the number of attempts made and the time spent on the work will be indicated in the message. I must say that it is long. As in the generated word must match ALL characters at once. 
This can take up to an hour 

When a given word is six characters or longer, the guessing is done character by character. This is fast. It takes milliseconds to guess a string of 1000 characters.
